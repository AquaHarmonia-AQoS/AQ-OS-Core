# AQ-OS MANIFEST
## Authoritative Structural Index

**Version:** v1.1  
**Status:** Authoritative Index  
**Scope:** AQ-OS Core Repository  
**Purpose:** Prevent drift, scope creep, and accidental reinterpretation of locked work.

This MANIFEST is the **primary source of truth** for the epistemic status, authority boundaries, and load-bearing structure of all artifacts in this repository.

If a file, folder, or claim is not consistent with this MANIFEST, it is **non-authoritative by default**.

---

## Purpose

AQ-OS (AquaHarmonia Operating System) is a human-centered systems framework designed to:

- preserve human agency  
- prevent authority drift in AI-assisted systems  
- maintain clarity through explicit structure  
- separate mythic or poetic expression from operational truth  

This repository contains the **Core Spine only**.

---

## Repository Structure & Authority Levels

Folder names encode authority boundaries.  
Authority is determined by **explicit listing in this MANIFEST**, not by implication.

### 🔒 `/LOCKED/` — Load-Bearing (Immutable by Default)

Foundational constraints that all other system components must conform to.

Changes here alter system behavior and require:
- an explicit version bump  
- written justification  
- and a changelog entry  

Contents include:
- Violation Policy Spine  
- Lane 1 Operator Composition  
- Lane 2 Viability Kernels & Geometry  
- Q-Sleeve Core Components  

> Note: Some LOCKED artifacts may be referenced from other folders.  
> **Logical authority, not physical location, determines lock status.**

---

### 🛠️ `/SPECS/` — Active Specifications

Operational documents used by builders and implementers.

These may evolve but **must remain compatible** with `/LOCKED/` constraints.

Contents include:
- Harness Specification  
- Retrieval & Field Activation  
- Integration & Extension Layer  

---

### 🧭 `/governance/` — Authority & Constraint Rules

Defines governance principles, authority boundaries, and constraint logic.

Nothing in this folder may override, reinterpret, or weaken `/LOCKED/` artifacts.

---

### 🧩 `/lanes/` — Operator & Kernel Organization

Organizational grouping for lane-specific artifacts.

Lane definitions derive authority from `/LOCKED/` sources and may not redefine them.

---

### 🧠 `/memory/` — Memory & Containment

Specifications for memory handling, retrieval boundaries, and containment rules.

All contents are subject to governance, SAFE constraints, and integrity checks.

---

### 🧱 `/integrity/` — Structural Verification

Defines how system consistency, manifests, and structural validity are checked.

This folder verifies structure; it does **not** define system behavior.

---

### 📓 `/DAILY/` — Operational Logbook

Dated daily entries documenting:
- decisions  
- migrations  
- scope changes  
- execution progress  

Nothing in `/DAILY/` is authoritative.

---

### 🗄️ `/ARCHIVE/` — Historical Reference

Preserved materials that informed development but are no longer load-bearing.

Nothing in `/ARCHIVE/` has operational authority.

---

## 🔒 What Is LOCKED (Do Not Modify)

The following artifacts define **foundational constraints**.

They may not be reinterpreted, extended, or contradicted without explicit revision.

### Core Foundations

- **AQ_OS Formal Foundations v1.0a**  
  Role: Viability core (bounds, metrics, assumptions)  
  Notes: All guarantees originate here.

---

### Lane 1 — Operator Composition (v1.0)

- Operator taxonomy (boop / bloop / floop / Null Field)  
- Chaining lemma and composition bounds  
- Order sensitivity rules  
- Contractive survival conditions  

These define what operators are **allowed** to do.

---

### Lane 2 — Viability Kernels & Geometry (v1.0)

- Viability kernel defined as a **set**, not a goal  
- Metric: distance-to-kernel  
- Explicit ban on “kernel center” semantics  

These define what **safe** means.

---

### Violation Policy Spine (v1.0)

- Response enum:
  - HALT  
  - DEGRADE_MODE  
  - SANDBOX_ONLY  
  - EXIT_WITH_REPORT  
- Rolling escalation rules  
- Event severity taxonomy  
- Deterministic response policy  

Failure handling is **explicit and final**.

---

### Q-SLEEVE (v0.1)

- Pre-claim / pre-authority containment layer  
- Exploration without admissible claims  
- One-way extraction only  

Q-SLEEVE material is **never evidence**.

---

## ▶ What Is CURRENT (Active & Valid)

Usable and extensible artifacts that **may not redefine** LOCKED work.

- Harness Specification (v0.1)  
- Toy Kernels (explicitly artificial; non-claim)  
- Validated Notes (derivative only; no new guarantees)

---

## ⏳ What Is INTENTIONALLY UNFINISHED

Open areas by design.  
They **may never be completed**.

- Lane 3 — Implementation Mapping  
- Lane 4 — Optional Strengthening  

Absence implies no obligation or roadmap.

---

## 🚫 Explicit Non-Goals

This project explicitly rejects:

- Claims of intelligence, agency, or consciousness  
- Optimization objectives or goal states  
- Autonomous decision authority  
- Moral, legal, or safety certification  
- Narrative or interpretive authority  

Meaning is allowed.  
Authority is constrained.

---

## 📐 Interpretation Rules

- Folder names encode authority boundaries  
- File headers override prose  
- `/LOCKED/` > `/SPECS/` > extensions > scratch  
- Extensions may consume outputs but may not redefine them  
- Absence ≠ intent  

If unsure, assume **lower authority**.

## Final Declaration

This MANIFEST exists to keep the system honest.
