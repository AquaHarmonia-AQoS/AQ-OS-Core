# AQ-OS MANIFEST
## Authoritative Structural Index

This document defines the **official structure, authority boundaries, and load-bearing components** of AQ-OS Core.

If a file, folder, or concept is not referenced here, it is **non-authoritative** by default.

---

## Purpose

AQ-OS (AquaHarmonia Operating System) is a human-centered systems framework designed to:

- preserve human agency
- prevent authority drift in AI-assisted systems
- maintain clarity through explicit structure
- separate mythic expression from operational truth

This repository contains the **Core Spine** only.

## Repository Structure & Authority Levels

### 🔒 `/LOCKED/` — Load-Bearing (Immutable by Default)

These documents define constraints that other systems must conform to.

Changes here alter system behavior and require deliberate review.

Contents include:
- Violation Policy Spine
- Lane 1 Operator Composition
- Lane 2 Kernels & Viability
- Q-Sleeve Core Components

---

### 🛠️ `/SPECS/` — Active Specifications

Operational documents used by builders, collaborators, and implementers.

These may evolve but must remain compatible with `/LOCKED/` constraints.

Contents include:
- Harness Specification
- Retrieval & Field Activation
- Integration & Extension Layer

---

### 📓 `/DAILY/` — Operational Logbook

Dated daily entries documenting:
- decisions
- migrations
- scope changes
- execution progress

This folder establishes temporal continuity and accountability.

---

### 🗄️ `/ARCHIVE/` — Historical Reference

Preserved materials that informed development but are no longer load-bearing.

Nothing in `/ARCHIVE/` has operational authority.

---

## Governance Principles

- No file governs unless explicitly referenced here
- Mythic or poetic language is **non-binding**
- AI systems assist; humans remain responsible
- Cold systems preserve warmth by refusing agency

---

## License

This project is released under the MIT License.
Use is unrestricted; responsibility remains human.

## Final Note

This manifest is the spine.

Everything else is muscle, memory, or movement.
