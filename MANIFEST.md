# AQ-OS MANIFEST
## Authoritative Structural Index

**Version:** v1.1  
**Status:** Authoritative Index  
**Scope:** AQ-OS Core Repository  
**Purpose:** Prevent drift, scope creep, and accidental reinterpretation of locked work.

This MANIFEST is the **primary source of truth** for the epistemic status, authority boundaries, and load-bearing structure of all artifacts in this repository.

If a file, folder, or claim is not consistent with this MANIFEST, it is **non-authoritative** by default.

---

## Purpose

AQ-OS (AquaHarmonia Operating System) is a human-centered systems framework designed to:

- preserve human agency
- prevent authority drift in AI-assisted systems
- maintain clarity through explicit structure
- separate mythic or poetic expression from operational truth

This repository contains the **Core Spine only**.

---

## Repository Structure & Authority Levels

Folder names encode authority boundaries.  
Authority is determined by **explicit listing here**, not by implication.

### 🔒 `/LOCKED/` — Load-Bearing (Immutable by Default)

Foundational constraints that other systems must conform to.

Changes here alter system behavior and require:
- an explicit version bump
- written justification
- and a changelog entry

Contents include:
- Violation Policy Spine
- Lane 1 Operator Composition
- Lane 2 Viability Kernels & Geometry
- Q-Sleeve Core Components

> Note: Some LOCKED artifacts may be referenced from other folders.  
> Logical authority, not physical location, determines

## Repository Structure & Authority Levels

Folder names encode authority boundaries.

### 🔒 `/LOCKED/` — Load-Bearing (Immutable by Default)

Foundational constraints that other systems must conform to.

Changes here alter system behavior and require:
- an explicit version bump
- written justification
- and a changelog entry

Contents include:
- Violation Policy Spine
- Lane 1 Operator Composition
- Lane 2 Viability Kernels & Geometry
- Q-Sleeve Core Components

---

### 🛠️ `/SPECS/` — Active Specifications

Operational documents used by builders and implementers.

These may evolve but **must remain compatible** with `/LOCKED/` constraints.

Contents include:
- Harness Specification
- Retrieval & Field Activation
- Integration & Extension Layer

---

### 📓 `/DAILY/` — Operational Logbook

Dated daily entries documenting:
- decisions
- migrations
- scope changes
- execution progress

This establishes temporal continuity and accountability.

---

### 🗄️ `/ARCHIVE/` — Historical Reference

Preserved materials that informed development but are no longer load-bearing.

Nothing in `/ARCHIVE/` has operational authority.

---

## 🔒 What Is LOCKED (Do Not Modify)

The following artifacts define **foundational constraints**.

They may not be reinterpreted, extended, or contradicted without explicit revision.

### Core Foundations

- **AQ_OS Formal Foundations v1.0a**  
  Role: Viability core (bounds, metrics, assumptions)  
  Notes: All guarantees originate here.

---

### Lane 1 — Operator Composition (v1.0)

- Operator taxonomy (boop / bloop / floop / Null Field)
- Chaining lemma and composition bounds
- Order sensitivity rules
- Contractive survival conditions

These define what operators are **allowed** to do.

---

### Lane 2 — Viability Kernels & Geometry (v1.0)

- Viability kernel defined as a **set**, not a goal
- Metric: distance-to-kernel
- Explicit ban on “kernel center” semantics

These define what **safe** means.

---

### Violation Policy Spine (v1.0)

- Response enum:
  - HALT
  - DEGRADE_MODE
  - SANDBOX_ONLY
  - EXIT_WITH_REPORT
- Rolling escalation rules
- Event severity taxonomy
- Deterministic response policy

Failure handling is **explicit and final**.

---

### Q-SLEEVE (v0.1)

- Pre-claim / pre-authority containment layer
- Exploration without admissible claims
- One-way extraction only

Q-SLEEVE material is **never evidence**.

---

## ▶ What Is CURRENT (Active & Valid)

These artifacts are usable and extensible, but **may not redefine** anything in `/LOCKED/`.

### Harness Specification (v0.1)

- Empirical envelope estimation
- Conservative, revocable bounds
- Hold-out falsification required
- Domain-limited by declaration

---

### Toy Kernels

- Explicitly artificial kernels for testing and demonstration
- Not claims about real system geometry

---

### Validated Notes

- Derived explanations or mappings
- Must reference LOCKED sources
- No new guarantees allowed

---

## ⏳ What Is INTENTIONALLY UNFINISHED

The following areas are open **by design**.

Their absence is not a promise.

### Lane 3 — Implementation Mapping

- Runtime monitor wiring
- Control-flow enforcement
- Deterministic vs stochastic execution
- Code-level realizations

---

### Lane 4 — Optional Strengthening (Opt-In Only)

- Asymptotic convergence proofs
- Stochastic variants
- Multi-metric or adaptive kernels
- Learning or adaptation mechanisms

No unfinished item implies future inclusion.

---

## 🚫 Explicit Non-Goals

This project explicitly rejects:

- Claims of intelligence, agency, or consciousness
- Optimization objectives or goal states
- Autonomous decision authority
- Moral, legal, or safety certification
- Narrative or interpretive authority

Meaning is allowed.  
Authority is constrained.

---

## 📐 Interpretation Rules (Humans & AI)

- Folder names encode authority boundaries
- File headers override prose
- `/LOCKED/` > `/SPECS/` > extensions > scratch
- Extensions may consume core outputs but may not redefine them
- Absence ≠ intent

If unsure, assume **lower authority**.

---

## Governance Principles

- No file governs unless explicitly referenced here
- Mythic or poetic language is **non-binding**
- AI systems assist; humans remain responsible
- Cold systems preserve warmth by refusing agency

---

## License

This project is released under the MIT License.  
Use is unrestricted; responsibility remains human.

---

## Final Declaration

This MANIFEST exists to keep the system honest.

- Bounds over beliefs  
- Failure over fantasy  
- Clarity over cleverness  

Anything not listed here is commentary.
